## Why Go

I'd been working through Go on [Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev) and wanted a real project to use it on — something that wasn't just contrived exercises. Picking up a new backend language felt overdue, and a personal blog is a nice scope: enough surface area to touch routing, storage, templates, and deployment without needing a framework or a team.

The nudge to actually pick Go came from my friend [Diyor](https://0xdiyor.com/#/). Watching him ship real things in it made "I should try this" turn into "I'm building the thing this weekend."

## The constraints

I wanted something I could:

1. Understand end-to-end
2. Deploy as a single binary + a file
3. Extend without fighting a framework

## What I picked

- ` + "`net/http`" + ` for routing — the 1.22+ ` + "`ServeMux`" + ` is finally good enough that a third-party router is unnecessary at this size.
- ` + "`database/sql`" + ` with ` + "`modernc.org/sqlite`" + ` for storage — pure-Go SQLite driver, no CGO, so cross-compiling to the EC2 box is dependency-free.
- ` + "`html/template`" + ` for rendering, ` + "`goldmark`" + ` for the Markdown → HTML pipeline, ` + "`chroma`" + ` for syntax highlighting.
- ` + "`embed.FS`" + ` to bake templates, static assets, and SQL migrations into the binary — one file ships everything.
- Caddy in front for auto-HTTPS, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, systemd for lifecycle. All standard-issue.

That's the whole stack. Under 1MB of Go source and one SQLite file for state.

## What's next

A few things on the list before I call this done:

- A small **admin login** so I can create/edit posts from the browser instead of running the ` + "`post`" + ` CLI over SSH.
- **Tags + filtering** on the index page.
- An **RSS feed** at ` + "`/blog/feed.xml`" + `.
- Eventually a **React frontend rebuild** against a JSON API — the server-rendered pages stay live in the meantime.

## Early on

I've been into tech since I was a kid. It started with jailbreaking my Apple stuff, rooting Android devices, and running hacks in whatever game my friends and I were into that year. I came to computers by jailbreaking PS3s and tearing apart APKs to spawn in-game items — that "what happens if I poke this" itch never really turned off. The through-line was always customization: if a thing was locked, I wanted to see what it looked like unlocked.

All of that ran in the background of my life. Somewhere along the way I fell hard for math, and by the end of high school I'd taken enough college classes at our local community college, [NJC](https://www.njc.edu/), to know that math + CS was the direction I wanted. So I applied to MSU Denver for the dual bachelor's — Computer Science and Mathematics — and I'm now one school year out from graduating.

## Outside of code

- **Reading** technical books — currently rotating through databases, Linux internals, web dev, and AI.
- **Hiking** with my girlfriend and friends. Working up to my first 14er.
- **Powerlifting** — the other kind of "poking things to see what happens."
- **Soccer** — huge fan. Vamos México.
- **Cats** — Luffy and Dio (and yes, from the anime, thanks for asking).
- **Anime + manga** — favorites are *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*, *Hunter x Hunter*, and *Neon Genesis Evangelion*; favorite manga are *Vagabond*, *The Climber*, and *Real*.

## The two stacks

| stack       | what                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| production  | S3 + CloudFront + Lambda + SES             |
| lab box     | EC2 t3.micro + Caddy + Cloudflare          |

Production is the static site. The lab box mirrors it for now and grows into client hosting.

## What I learned

- **IAM first** — replace root for daily use immediately, MFA on the root account.
- **$5 budget alert** before launching anything else.
- **CloudFront in front of S3** is the standard pattern; Route 53 for DNS.
- **Caddy auto-SSL + Cloudflare in front of EC2** keeps TLS painless.

The whole thing runs at roughly **$0/mo** at low traffic.
